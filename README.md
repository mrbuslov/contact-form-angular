Contact Form in 2 ways: Anguar and JS (jQuery)

# Task
Preparation of the contact form
● the basis of the form is a simple landing page with a white background
● the form is centred both horizontally and vertically
● the form has the title "Contact me" and the subtitle "We are always happy to find out
what's on your mind"
● The form has three fields (name, e-mail address and message content) and the "Send"
button
● all fields in the form are validated: in the first name field, only the first name can be
entered and in the e-mail field only the e-mail address. Incorrect field validation is
signalled in red.
● the "Message content" field allows to enter up to 120 characters
● the "Submit" button is a CTA (so it is styled as such)
● the "Send" button is inactive when the form is incorrectly completed
● the design should be elegant, legible and clear, and the operation should be intuitive and
consistent with the habits of users
Stage one - creation in your favourite technology.
Stage two - creation in angular.
