# Task
Preparation of the contact form
● the basis of the form is a simple landing page with a white background

● the form is centred both horizontally and vertically

● the form has the title "Contact me" and the subtitle "We are always happy to find out
what's on your mind"

● The form has three fields (name, e-mail address and message content) and the "Send"
button

● all fields in the form are validated: in the first name field, only the first name can be
entered and in the e-mail field only the e-mail address. Incorrect field validation is
signalled in red.

● the "Message content" field allows to enter up to 120 characters

● the "Submit" button is a CTA (so it is styled as such)

● the "Send" button is inactive when the form is incorrectly completed

● the design should be elegant, legible and clear, and the operation should be intuitive and
consistent with the habits of users

Stage one - creation in your favourite technology.

Stage two - creation in angular.
